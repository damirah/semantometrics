Swiss System for Monitoring bibliographic data and Holistic publication behavior analysis” (SYMPHONY): Requirement analysis
The objective of the “Swiss System for Monitoring bibliographic data and Holistic publication behavior analysis” (SYMPHONY) project was to set up a study that is able to monitor the publication behavior of researchers in Switzerland in systematic and continuing way. Due to the complexity of these tasks and the high number of stakeholders involved, SYMPHONY was conceptualized as a pre-study that identifies and analyses the requirements of the key stakeholders towards such as system. 
Several methods have been used to reach the project goal: In a first step, a review of the international literature gave valuable insights in the potential, but also the problems associated with current approaches towards monitoring publication behavior by means of bibliometrics (e.g. bias against Open Access publication formats). As a second methodological step, the project team ran a stakeholder dialog that included 40 interviews with key stakeholders and experts in the field (all universities and most universities of applied sciences, a selection of research organizations, funding agencies, bibliometric experts etc.) This stakeholder dialog was necessary in order to take the considerable heterogeneity and decentralized structure of the Swiss science system into account. The interview partners were asked about their current practice of measuring the quantity and quality of scientific output with a focus on publication monitoring (technical infrastructure, financial resources, organizational guidelines and processes) and their needs and requirements for a new or adapted infrastructure.
The expert interviews have clearly shown that the majority of stakeholders in the Swiss science systems considers the current status quo of bibliographic data collection and publication analysis problematic because a number of scientific disciplines (social sciences and humanities) and a considerable amount of scientific publication formats (e.g. narrow selection of books and book chapters, exclusion of peer reviewed journals that are not included in the dominant bibliometric data base) are not adequately represented in the dominant bibliometric systems (e.g. Web of Science by Thomson Reuters). Based on the findings from the expert interviews, the project team has developed the following four scenarios: (1) maintain status quo, (2) perform targeted studies, (3) create a new infrastructure for monitoring the publication behavior of Swiss scientists, (4) scenario (3) plus a framework for assessing the societal impact of publications, projects and institutions. 
These scenarios were presented to the experts and stakeholders at the project workshop with the opportunity to comment and to provide feedback. One important result of the workshop was that the participants recommended to focus on scenario 3 for the further project development by aiming at the creation of a new infrastructure with a clearly and narrowly defined task to monitor the publication behavior of Swiss scientists. Based on the feedback from the stakeholder workshop, the project team has developed a revised and detailed version of scenario 3 that was considered as best approach to meet the ambitious goals set by the White Paper. The final chapter list the requirements for the current and future monitoring of scientific publications in Switzerland and gives a preview on the planned follow-up project “SYMPHONY - Proof of concept”.
