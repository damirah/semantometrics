Altmetrics and the Role of Librarians
As altmetrics have emerged and continue to grow and evolve, so too has the role that academic librarians play in supporting altmetrics, metrics, and impact, from support to professional use to advocacy. Any librarian in this field will need to continue not only filling these roles, but also ensuring that they themselves are part of the conversation as it moves forward and staying up-to-date with developments within this area.
The concept of library involvement pertaining to metrics did not originate with altmetrics. As explained in chapter 1, Impact Factor was originally created primarily for use by librarians in making collection development and retention decisions. Libraries continue to bear primary responsibility for the acquisition of bibliometrics tools, most notably Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports, and Scopus, as well as the training of people in their use. As a result, librarians are already familiar with providing support for these tools, so it makes sense that librarians have expanded to support the variety of altmetrics sources and tools discussed in chapter 2.
Additionally, librarians serve as natural leaders when it comes to altmetrics, not only due to familiarity with resources, but also because of the relationships they maintain with several disparate groups. As a result, librarians serve as a neutral voice and advocate on behalf of the needs of their community, while also providing insight about the tools and metrics they help support through their own experience and expertise.
The following sections detail some specific areas in which libraries and librarians are supporting and interacting with altmetrics.
