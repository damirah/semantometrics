Issues, Controversies, and Opportunities for Altmetrics
For academic librarians attempting to assess the potential of the present-day altmetrics landscape, it is just as important to consider the larger discussions that have emerged surrounding the field of altmetrics as it is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of specific altmetrics tools. 
As mentioned briefly in chapter 1, the general altmetrics movement has alternatively suffered and benefitted from a number of exaggerations that have circulated about its aims and goals. While misunderstandings are inevitable in any effort to change the way that academe approaches sensitive topics like impact, promotion, funding, and tenure, some of these comments have pointed toward genuine weaknesses that the altmetrics movement has struggled to address, or toward unique strengths on which it is attempting to capitalize. 
In this chapter, we look at some of the most important issues to come out of the last five years of altmetrics discussion, including the controversies and opportunities that are most poised to affect its ultimate adoption, negatively or positively, across the wider expanse of higher education.
