Impact Factor Wars: Episode V--The Empire Strikes Back
Too bad it is not ‘‘A long time ago in a galaxy far,far  away...’’  Instead,  it  is  the  21st  century  and European, Canadian, and American scientists are now in the grips of a menace that threatens their livelihood: the journal impact factor (a proprietary calculation based on journal citations and produced by the monolithic news and information empire Thomson Reuters) is being used in many places to determine academic employment,rank, tenure, and funding.1-9In the past, few voices have protested  the  abusive  power  associated  with  journal impact factor, and publishers generally shrank in terror at  the  prospect  of  their  journals  being  subjected  to  the‘‘death  penalty’’—removal  from  the  Thomson  Reuters journal  impact  factor  listing.  However,  in  2007,  th eExecutive Director of the powerful Rockefeller University Press, along with the Executive Editors of the Journal of Experimental  Medicine and  the Journal  of  Cell  Biology,courageously questioned the validity and reliability of the journal  impact  factor  calculations. These  editorials (by  Mike  Rossner,  Heather  Van  Epps,  and  Emma  Hill) emboldened  others  to  voice  concerns  about  the  use  of an  unverifiable  and  proprietary  metric—journal  impact factor—to evaluate the quality of scientific work.
